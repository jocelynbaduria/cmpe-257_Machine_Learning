Data Definitions

Our team used dataset from NASA and we perform data cleaning for the following features:

          1. dia = Diameter                     
          2. rot_per  = Rotation Period         
          3. e = Eccentricity
          4. a = Semi-major Axis (longest arm of the orbit around the sun measured in AU(Astronomical Unit)
          5. q = Perihelion distance
          6. ad = Aphelion distance
